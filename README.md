Program to calculate net salary.
# Params to calculate net salary:
 The tax on salary:
- If the salary is less than or equal USD 100, the tax will be 0% of the gross.
- If the salary is greater than USD 100 and less than or equal to USD 300, the tax will be 20%.
- If the salary is greater than USD 300, the tax will be 28%.
 Medication insurance will carry 5% of the gross salary
 Maternity leave will carry 0.3 percent of the gross salary
 Social security fund will carry 3% of the gross salary

# Advantage of using pointer:
- Memory efficiency as we won't be passing copy of variables but memory address of the variable.
- Performance as passing by reference is faster than passing by value.
- No redudant return variables as we are going to modify the addresses directly.
- Direct modification of variables.

# How to run the program:
  -  compile: gcc -C netSalary.c -o netSalary
  -  run: netSalary
